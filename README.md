## Version 2 with Testing

This project contains the same source code files as the main branch copied into a Gradle project to include unit testing with JUnit.


## How to Run
In IntelliJ, you can run each test individually (located in src.test.java.ReimburserTest) by clicking the green arrow next to each test. Alternately, you can run command "./gradlew test" to run all the tests at once.
